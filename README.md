### What is Rofi?

Rofi is A window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement. Rofi started as a clone of simpleswitcher and It has been extended with extra features, like an application launcher and ssh-launcher, and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool. Rofi, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options where one or more can be selected. This can either be running an application, selecting a window, or options provided by an external script. More <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">here...</a>
